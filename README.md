# Arduino-car
Code for an Arduino car kit made by Elegoo.

## Project Description

This is a project to teach a class of middle school level students programming. Most of the current students are part of
*FIRST* Robotic Challenge (FTC) team 13061. The Arduino car kit is used as an easy to build platform for learning coding.

## The Class Project

Sample code are provided on a DVD that came with the car kit. Each sample demostrates a single functionality of the car.
In the class, students learn to put these functions together into a
[combined program](https://github.com/ww9rivers/Arduino-car/tree/master/Combo), using an IR controller to select
the car's op mode.
